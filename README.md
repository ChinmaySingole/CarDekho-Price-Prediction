# CarDekho Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the price of a used car based on its features. The model is trained using a dataset of used cars sold on Cardekho.com in India. By leveraging machine learning, we can provide accurate price estimations for sellers and buyers, making the used car market more efficient.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a suitable machine learning model for used car price prediction.

## Benefits

- For Sellers: Helps in setting a competitive and fair price, leading to faster sales and better profits.

- For Buyers: Assists in finding well-priced cars based on market trends.

- For the Market: Increases efficiency in the used car market by reducing price mismatches.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features of used cars, including:

- Car Name

- Year of Manufacture

- Selling Price

- Present Price

- Kms Driven

- Fuel Type

- Seller Type

- Transmission

- Owner Type


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ChinmaySingole/-CarDekho-Price-Prediction.git
```
    
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd used-CarDekho-Price-Prediction
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook project.ipynb
```
4. Run the notebook cells to train the model and make predictions.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional features like car condition and geographical data.

- Improve model accuracy with advanced algorithms.

- Deploy the model as a web application.
